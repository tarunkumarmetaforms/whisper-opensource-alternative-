# Scaling FastAPI + Faster-Whisper Transcription Service

This guide explains how to scale your transcription service to support 1,000 concurrent users.

## Key Areas to Address

### 1. Concurrency and Parallel Processing

- FastAPI provides async support but transcription can block the event loop
- Use thread/process pools to offload transcription work
- Submit jobs to pool and await results to prevent blocking

### 2. Model Loading and Sharing 

- Load Whisper model once at startup
- Share model instance across requests
- Be aware of GPU parallelism limitations (8-16 concurrent jobs)
- CPU allows more parallel jobs but performance degrades with core saturation

### 3. Scaling Strategies

- **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple FastAPI instances with load balancing
- **Vertical scaling**: More powerful hardware (CPU/GPU)
- **Model selection**: Consider smaller models for higher throughput

### 4. Async File Handling

- Use FastAPI's async features for uploads
- Offload transcription to worker pool

### 5. Production Best Practices

- Tune thread/process pool size for hardware
- Implement request queueing
- Add monitoring and autoscaling
